## Project Introduction
**Operating Room Crisis** is an innovative board game designed specifically for medical students.  
Its core objective is to strengthen students’ **aseptic techniques**, **minimally invasive surgical skills**, and **clinical decision-making abilities** in the operating room.  

In today’s medical environment, minimally invasive surgery is both highly complex and risky, posing major challenges for medical students. Traditional training methods are costly and difficult to repeat, limiting opportunities for hands-on practice.  

To address this issue, we designed this board game. By adopting a **gamified learning approach**, it simulates the pressure and teamwork of real surgeries, enabling students to repeatedly practice in a **low-risk, highly flexible** environment.

## Core Features
### Dual-Phase Game Design
1. **Preoperative Aseptic Challenge** – Focused on aseptic practices before surgery.  
2. **Minimally Invasive Surgery Stage** – Simulates the process of **laparoscopic cholecystectomy**.  

### Handling Emergencies
Unexpected events such as **postoperative bleeding** or **intra-abdominal infection** may occur.  
Players must make the correct decisions, or they will face **Game Over**, training students’ clinical adaptability.  

### Comprehensive Evaluation System
The built-in evaluation mechanism assesses learning outcomes from multiple perspectives, including:  
- Medical knowledge  
- Procedural proficiency  
- Teamwork skills  

It also provides **personalized feedback** to help students improve and progress.  

### Low Cost and High Flexibility
Compared with traditional surgical simulation training, this board game offers **low cost, easy adjustability, and expandability**.  
Future modules could include other surgical scenarios, such as **laparoscopic appendectomy**.
