# Operating Room Crisis

## Project Introduction
**Operating Room Crisis** is an innovative board game designed specifically for medical students.  
Its primary goal is to enhance students¡¦ **aseptic techniques**, **minimally invasive surgical skills**, and **clinical decision-making abilities** within an operating room setting.

In today¡¦s medical environment, minimally invasive surgery poses high levels of complexity and risk, making it a major challenge for medical students. Traditional training methods are often costly and difficult to repeat, which limits students¡¦ opportunities to practice.  

To address this issue, we developed this board game to **gamify surgical training** by simulating real-world surgical stress and teamwork scenarios. Students can repeatedly practice in a **low-risk, flexible environment**, gaining valuable experience without the constraints of traditional training.

## Core Features
### ? Two-Stage Game Design
1. **Preoperative Aseptic Challenge** ¡V Focuses on aseptic skills before surgery.  
2. **Minimally Invasive Surgery Stage** ¡V Simulates a laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure.

### ? Emergency Situations
During gameplay, unexpected events such as **postoperative bleeding** or **intra-abdominal infections** may occur. Players must make correct decisions; otherwise, they will face a **¡§Game Over¡¨** penalty. This trains students¡¦ adaptability under pressure.

### ? Comprehensive Evaluation System
The game includes a built-in assessment mechanism that evaluates players across multiple dimensions:
- Medical knowledge  
- Technical proficiency  
- Teamwork skills  

It also provides **personalized feedback** to guide learning.

### ? Cost-Effective & Flexible
Compared to traditional surgical simulations, this board game is **low-cost, highly adaptable, and expandable**. Future scenarios may include other surgeries such as **laparoscopic appendectomy**.
